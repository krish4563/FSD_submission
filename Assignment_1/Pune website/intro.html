        <b class="highlighted-text">Pune:</b> (Marathi pronunciation: [puɳe]; English: /ˈpuːnə/ also called Poona, the official name until 1978), is the second largest city in the Indian state of Maharashtra after Mumbai (Earlier Bombay). The local language is Marathi and the majority of the population is also fluent in Hindi and English.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is the ninth most populous city in India with an estimated population of over 3.13 million. Along with its extended city limits Pimpri Chinchwad and the three cantonment towns of Pune, Khadki, and Dehu Road, Pune forms the urban core of the eponymous Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR).
    </p>
    <p>
        According to the 2011 census, the urban area has a combined population of 5.05 million while the population of the metropolitan region is estimated at 7.27 million. Situated 560 metres (1,837 feet) above mean sea level on the Deccan plateau on the banks of the Mutha and Mula rivers, Pune is also the administrative headquarters of its namesake district.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the 18th century, the city was the seat of the Peshwas, the prime ministers of the Maratha Empire and so was one of the most important political centres on the Indian subcontinent. Pune is ranked the number one city in India in the ease of living ranking index.

    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Oxford of the East: because of a huge number of educational institutes,</li>
        <li>Detroit of India: because of a large number of automobile manufacturers,</li>
        <li>Queen of the Deccan: because in earlier days Pune or Poona was a salubrious green city with a "Hill station like atmosphere” and was hence the best city on the Deccan Plateau.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The city has emerged as a major educational hub in recent decades, with nearly half of the total international students in the country studying in Pune.
